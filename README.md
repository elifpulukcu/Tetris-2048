# Tetris-2048,

This project is an undergraduate course project. Project constraints and requirements are as follows:

- In this project, you will develop a game in Java using the basic drawing class (StdDraw) provided by the book: [Computer Science: An Interdisciplinary Approach by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.]([/guides/content/editing-an-existing-page#modifying-front-matter](https://anvilproject.org/guides/content/creating-links))
- The game you will develop is a combination of two well-known games: Tetris and 2048.

  * You are not allowed to use other libraries. 
  * The StdDraw class provides basic drawing capabilities for Java programs. 
  * It enables the creation of simple geometric shapes such as lines, squares, rectangles, circles, and ellipses. 
  * It also contains functions for writing text, changing colors, using images (pictures), creating animations, and interacting with the user via keyboard and mouse. 
  * Well-prepared documentation about the usage of the StdDraw class can be viewed [here.](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/javadoc/StdDraw.html)

- You can find the demo video of the project [here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XaQPz4KUzTgGX5y3uey2N5CHaRBhTOiN/view?usp=sharing)
